Converter from Consistent_Trees output to galacticus input format

This program can be used to convert merger trees generated with
Consistent-Trees.

The Consistent-Trees Code can be downloaded at
http://code.google.com/p/consistent-trees/
The Code Paper can be found here:
see http://arxiv.org/pdf/1110.4370v2

- Requirements
You need to have the hdf5 library installed.
On e.g. Ubuntu you can install them via the command
"sudo apt-get install libhdf5-serial-1.8.4 libhdf5-serial-dev"

- Compiling
Compiling should be as easy as typing "make" in the code
directory.

- Running
It is necessary to provide a parameter file (see e.g. parameter.cfg) which
specifies the input file location, the name of the output file as
well as several attributes which will be written into the galacticus input
file as meta-data. Some of these attributes will be used by galacticus.

The code can be run trough 
./convert <parameter_file>

It is possible to inspect the output hdf5 file with tools like HDFView.
